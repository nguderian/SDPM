# SDPM-v2

This Repository will be divided into 2 sub directories:

* Frontend
* Backend

## Workflow

This is to ensure that people don't overlap with each other's code. 

1. **NEVER** push your code to master!
2. Create feature branches for the things you work on.
3. Keep each branch limited to one feature at a time.  This means work on one thing at a time.
4. Name your branch `feature/(...name of feature...)`.
5. Each branch will be reviewed and then merged into master.
6. Before you start working each day, **MAKE SURE** you do `git pull origin master` from the branch you are working on, to ensure you have most up to date code from master and that your features still work.
7. Have good commit messages.  It doesn't need to be super long but makes sure that we can understand what your commit is for.
8. Try to keep commits smaller rather than larger.  In other words don't wait until your feature is totally don to push your commit. 
* This is so that everyone can track their own progress as work gets more complex. 
* Also makes it easier to revert to an older version if you really really screwed up.
